# Demo
Powerful component to generate pagination with skip buttons and threshold

# Basic Usage
Pagination component works based on the limit, offset and the total
limit is the limit of the items per page, offset is the current offset of items, and total is the total count of the items

<br />

<Playground>
<Pagination
    className='foobar' // classname for wrapper of the pagination
    limit={10} // limit of the items of data
    offset={0} // current offset of the data
    total={200} // total items
    onPaginate={offset => console.log(offset)} // callback after clicking on pagination buttons
    threshold={5} // limit the items before and after of active item
    hasNavigateButtons={true} // makes next and prev buttons available
    hasSkipButtons={true} // makes first and last buttons available
/>
</Playground>

<br />

# Note
<p>
    <b>threshold</b> is the count of page buttons, before and after active page button.
    if there are less pages before the active page than the threshold, it would add it to next, and it will do the same for opposite condition
</p>
<p>
    <b>onPaginate</b> would give you offset of clicked page button, you can pass it to your api to get response with new offset.
