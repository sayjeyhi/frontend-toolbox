# Countdown
the countdown component is a useful countdown that gives you customization ability to implement the count down however you want.
the remaining time renders using the render method of the react-dom instead of updating the state, so there's no worry about the re-rendering overheads.


<br />

# Basic Usage
<Playground>
  <Countdown date={new Date(Date.now() + (1000 *  60 * 60 * 24 * 10))} />
</Playground>

<br />

# Customization
you can simply pass a children function to customize the timer, it gives you days, hours, minutes and options as the children parameters in an object.

<Playground>
  <Countdown
    date={new Date(Date.now() + (1000 *  60 * 60 * 24 * 10))}
    onStart={date => console.log("start", date)}
    onEnd={date => console.log("start", date)}
  >
    {({days, hours, minutes, seconds}) => (
      <>
        <h3>here is a 10 days countdown</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>days: {days}</li>
          <li>hours: {hours}</li>
          <li>minutes: {minutes}</li>
          <li>seconds: {seconds}</li>
        </ul>
      </>
    )}
  </Countdown>
</Playground>
