## Installation
It is easy to install our packages, if you are using `npm` you could easily install it on your
project by running one of this commands(based on your needs).
```bash
// with npm
npm i @snappmarket/ui
npm i @snappmarket/hooks
npm i @snappmarket/helpers

// with yarn
yarn add @snappmarket/ui
yarn add @snappmarket/hooks
yarn add @snappmarket/helpers
```

Please note that react >= 16.8.0 and react-dom >= 16.8.0 are peer dependencies.


We provide single usage possibility to install single module of helpers, hooks or components.
For this purpose you could run installation with a suffix for example, if you want to use only `Accordion` component
you could install it by :
```bash
// with npm
npm i @snappmarket/ui-accordion

// with yarn
yarn add @snappmarket/ui-accordion
```
This role is available for every single packages in `hooks` or `helpers`, so you could install them like :
```bash
// with npm
npm i @snappmarket/ui-accordion
npm i @snappmarket/ui-accordion

// with yarn
yarn add @snappmarket/ui-accordion
```

## Usage
There is not much config to use `helpers`, `hooks` or `icons`, and they are side effect free.
But we used styled components to make our ui components a little bit styled, so you should add styled component wrapper with our `makeTheme()`
function to build a theme for you. So you should have some codes like :
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import { makeTheme } from '@snappmarket/ui';

const theme = makeTheme();

// eslint-disable-next-line react/prop-types
const Wrapper = ({ children }) => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>
);

```
Then you can use any ui component in your project.
